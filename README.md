- 👋 Hi, I’m @gregverp, my full name is a french boring one, so everyone calls me Greg.
- 👀 I’m interested in eSports, Rugby (NOT american football!), and I like to party 🥂
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to become a full-stack dev: I am getting a bachelor's degree in IT. Thus, I am studying algorithm, data structures,... (mostly in Java), networking, databases, some web (mostly JS and php) and math!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on every small to mid-scale project youd want me to work on !
- 📫 How to reach me: mostly via Discord (Zigith#2814), or via my mail.
